# Parkinson-Disease-Prediction

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement and coordination. It occurs due to the gradual degeneration of nerve cells in the brain, leading to a decline in dopamine production. This results in symptoms such as muscle stiffness, involuntary tremors, and slowed movement, which may initially be subtle and difficult to notice. Over time, these symptoms worsen, affecting a person’s ability to perform daily activities.

One of the major challenges in diagnosing Parkinson’s disease is the lack of a definitive test or biomarker. Currently, diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation, medical history, and observation of symptoms, which can sometimes lead to misdiagnosis or delayed detection. However, with advancements in technology, machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for identifying patterns in medical data that might indicate the presence of Parkinson’s disease.

By analyzing various physiological parameters, speech patterns, and motor function data, machine learning models can help predict whether a person is likely to have Parkinson’s. This approach has the potential to enhance early diagnosis, allowing for timely intervention and better disease management. In this article, we will explore how machine learning can be applied to detect Parkinson’s disease, the types of data used in these models, and the impact this technology could have on improving diagnostic accuracy.
